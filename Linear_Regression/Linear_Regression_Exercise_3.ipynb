        "This code performs linear regression using TensorFlow/Keras to predict car fuel efficiency (`mpg`) based on input features: `cylinders`, `displacement`, and `weight`. The input features are normalized using a `Normalization` layer to improve training stability. The model is trained on **300 samples** and validated on **98 samples**, using **150 epochs**, a **batch size of 2**, and a **learning rate of 0.001**. It uses **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** as the loss function and **Stochastic Gradient Descent**\n"
